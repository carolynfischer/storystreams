#Storystreams.me - hackathon project for Garage48 hackathon
October 10-12, 2014, PÃ¤rnu, Estonia

The idea was to create a place to blog in pictures only (or very short descriptions) and let people tag the pictures. This would create a collective "memory" about events, be it current day relevant occasions that need to be brought to people's attention or past events. It would also allow to create pictorial stories about people to gather memories of people.

The site storystreams.me was up for a year, but as I moved across the globe, I didn't have time to develop it further. If you want, then take the codebase and go on with the project, I will give you all of the tech support I can to make this beautiful idea a reality again. :)
